Q : What is the approximate time taken to laod 50 million rows of data in HDFS from RDBMS 

Ans : 

Need to get the no of rows  , Can't determine from number of columns 
It totally depend upon number of task slots (1 unit of CPU and I unit of Ram , Can be confugired) 
It is advisible to give n/2 no of available slots ( where n -> total no of task slots availabale )

Say that there is 50gb of data 

5 task slots are assigned and it takes around 10 mins to process  500 MB of data . 
Thus after 10 mins it will process 2.5Gb of data 

It will take around 200 mins to process the 50 GB of data
